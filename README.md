# Disaster_Response_Pipeline
## Motivation
This project analyzes real disaster data messages from [Figure Eight](https://appen.com/) and builds an API model that classifies disaster messages by creating a machine learning pipeline to categorize these disaster events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.
The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also displays visualizations of the data.

Below are a few screenshots of the web app.
